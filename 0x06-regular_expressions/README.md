# 0x06. Regular expression
---
## Description

This project in the System engineering & DevOps Programming series is about:
* Understanding regular expression and use cases

## How it works
This project is built using Oniguruma to build regular expressions, a library used by Ruby by default and of course with Ruby language.

## How it compiles
No need to compile since it is all ruby scripts. Just make sure it is executable, if not use the "chmod u+x <file>" command
