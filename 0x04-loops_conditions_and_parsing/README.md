# 0x04. Loops, conditions and parsing
---
## Description

This project in the System engineering & DevOps ― Bash series is about:
* How to create SSH keys
* What is the advantage of using #!/usr/bin/env bash over #!/bin/bash
* How to use while, until and for loops
* How to use if, else, elif and case condition statements
* How to use the cut command
* What are files and other comparison operators, and how to use them

## How it works
You can open the file with your favorite editor to see the bash command and read the comments on the second line or use the "cat" command

## How to compile it
Since all files are Bash scripts, there is no need to execute. Just run it in the command line
