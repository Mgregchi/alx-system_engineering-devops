# 0x14. Mysql
---
## Description

This project in the System engineering & DevOps â€• Web stack series is about:
* What is the main role of a database
* What is a database replica
* What is the purpose of a database replica
* Why database backups need to be stored in different physical locations
* What operation should you regularly perform to make sure that your database backup strategy actually works

## Main objective and why?
Install and configure MySQL on 404-web-01 and 404-web-02 so that they form a primary/replica (master/slave) cluster.
1. Redundancy: If you lose one of the database servers, you will still have another working one and a copy of your data
2. Load distribution: You can split the read operations between the 2 servers, reducing the load on the primary member and improving query response speed

## Note
All Bash Script need to be executable and passes Shellcheckversion 0.3.3-1~ubuntu14.04.1) without any error
