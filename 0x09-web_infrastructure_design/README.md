## General Learning Objectives

This project in the System engineering & DevOps ― Web stack series is about:
* Create diagrams covering the web stack you built with the sysadmin/devops track projects
* Learning and being able to explain what are each component doing
* Explain system redundancy
* Know all the mentioned acronyms: LAMP, SPOF, QPS


## General Requirements

    - A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
    - For each task, once you are done whiteboarding (on a whiteboard, piece of paper or software or your choice), take a picture/screenshot of your diagram
    - This project will be manually reviewed:
    - As each task is completed, the name of that task will turn green
    - Upload a screenshot, showing that you completed the required levels, to any image hosting service (I personally use imgur but feel free to use anything you want).
    - For the following tasks, insert the link from of your screenshot into the answer file
    - After pushing your answer file to GitHub, insert the - GitHub file link into the URL box
    - You will also have to whiteboard each task in front of a mentor, staff or student - no computer or notes will be allowed during the whiteboarding session
    - Focus on what you are being asked:
    - Cover what the requirements mention, we will explore details in a later project
    - Keep in mind that you will have 30 minutes to perform the exercise, you will get points for what is asked in requirements
    - Similarly in a job interview, you should answer what the interviewer asked for, be careful about being too verbose - always ask the interviewer if going into details is necessary - speaking too much can play against you
    - In this project, again, avoid going in details if not asked
